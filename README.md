# ML_group

Main branch includes a folder dataset with the different CSV's 
Each person should create their branch and also their own notebook which they will work from
Better not work on main 

## Project Evaluation

- Standard track: each group uses the provided exemplary dataset and explore a dataset to present a non-obvious, compelling story using a notebook/dashboard (we have some exemplary datasets for you to choose as well)
- Adventurer track: each group needs to propose own question with strong business implications and use sophisticated approaches to achieve state-of-the-art results
- Students are responsible to structure the analysis and decide and evaluate different machine learning techniques to be used. The course project will be discussed with and evaluated by the instructor/TA at the beginning of week 8 and 14
- The final delivered project should be a complete machine learning pipeline
- (total of 3 models)
- We will assign the project group based on your student numbers
- Each student is expected to perform analysis and should be able to explain the project

## TO DO's:
- Go through slides 
- Which variable are we going to predict?
- Discuss which model we want 
- All go through the dataset
- Try to get the columns of the dataset 

## Tuesday Session Meeting at 15:00
Business application decided: *environmental monitoring* - the dataset contains a wide range of environmental variables, including elevation, slope, soil type, and climate data. By building machine learning models to analyze these variables, businesses and organizations can gain insights into the impact of different environmental factors on forest health and use these insights to develop more effective environmental monitoring programs.

## TO DO
MODELS:
- Classification model (cover type per area)
- Decision tree
- Clustering (Clustering is a technique in unsupervised machine learning that does not necessarily involve the use of a model, at least not in the traditional sense)

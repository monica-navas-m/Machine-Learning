    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The cover type is the plant growth characteristic of an area. Forests are one of the most critical ecosystems on our planet, and they provide a range of benefits to both people and the environment. However, forests around the world are facing numerous threats, including deforestation, invasive species, and climate change impacts. To address these issues, we need a better understanding of the state of the forest ecosystem and the factors that influence forest health. This is where environmental monitoring comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our area of interest is Colorado, US, and we aim to provide academical research that will serve as environmental monitoring, which is a critical aspect of sustainable forest management, as it allows us to understand the state of a forest ecosystem and identify potential threats to its health. By analyzing the cartographic variables and forest cover type data in this project, we gain insights into the relationship between different environmental factors and forest health.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Covertype\" dataset contains information about forest cover types, data originally derived from the US Forest Service (USFS) and the US Geological Survey (USGS), which can be used to inform various environmental monitoring and management applications. The study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest (1.5 million acres) of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our scientific research aims to lay the foundation to serve as a benchmark for managerial choices in forest management. Using machine learning models, we can analyze changes of the forest cover over time and identify areas that are undergoing rapid change or that are particularly vulnerable to environmental threats."

    "# Business applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Our environmental monitoring services can ideally benefit a range of clients, but since the area under study, is not affected by woodland exploitation, this research is directed to the government or conservation organizations for the purpose of better management and planning over time. This area has great potential, and our research can be combined in the future with research on local wildlife and animal movement, so that the Colorado state government can properly document and administer the forested space (whether there is the presence of particularly flammable shrubs and where, cleaning the understory in order to prevent fires).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does this research have a feasible impact?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically talking about wildfires, there is a growing trend, 2020 witnessed the highest number of wildfires ever recorded in the history of the state of Colorado.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Image1.jpeg\" alt=\"Burned Colorado acres\" width=\"400\" height=\"350\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In October 2020, nearly 442,000 acres in north-central Colorado and southern Wyoming have been affected by this season’s wildfires, according to the Rocky Mountain Coordination Center. Approximately 3.000 firefighters and support personnel were involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Image2.jpeg\" alt=\"Burned Colorado acres\" width=\"200\" height=\"350\">\n",
    "\n",
    "With this research, we provide valuable insights for informed decision-making, benefiting governments and conservation organizations. They can make better choices regarding forest management, wildfire prevention, conservation planning, and climate change adaptation in the Roosevelt National Forest and its surroundings. Additionally, this can be bought and licenced to serve as environmental consulting services from interested organizations operating in or near forested areas in Colorado (and Wyoming). It would help them comply with wildfire prevention regulations, develop emergency response plans, and ensure adherence to environmental laws and guidelines. Expenditures can be minimized on their operations, promoting sustainable practices and safeguarding the long-term sustainability of Colorado's forests."

    "\n",
    "In order to predict forest cover types based on cartographic variables, our team has selected six different machine learning models, which are well-suited to this dataset and our business case. Below we explain why we opted for those models:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Decision Tree:** Decision trees are an ideal choice for our dataset because they can handle both numerical and categorical features, like the binary columns for wilderness areas and soil types. These models are easily interpretable and can capture non-linear relationships between features and the target variable. Moreover, they are capable of selecting the most relevant features for prediction, which can help improve overall model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Logistic Regression**: is a well-established classification algorithm that is suitable for this dataset. It is useful when the relationship between the features and the target variable is expected to be linear. Logistic Regression models estimate the probabilities of each class, making them interpretable and providing insights. They can handle both numerical and categorical features, making them applicable to our dataset with cartographic variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Neural Network**: they have gained significant popularity in recent years due to their ability to capture complex patterns and relationships in data. They are capable of learning hierarchical representations of features, which can be advantageous when dealing with high-dimensional datasets like ours. Neural Networks excel in capturing non-linear relationships and can handle a wide range of data types. They have the potential to uncover intricate patterns in the cartographic variables and make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **XGBoosting:** Extreme Gradient Boosting, is a powerful machine learning algorithm that enhances gradient boosting. It excels in handling complex datasets with high dimensionality and non-linear relationships. XGBoosting incorporates regularization techniques and optimized algorithms, providing advantages such as faster computation speed and parallel processing. By combining weak prediction models, it creates a strong ensemble. Including XGBoosting alongside other models in our ensemble allows us to explore diverse algorithms and maximize accuracy. Thorough evaluation will determine its contribution to predicting forest cover types based on cartographic variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Random Forests:** they are well-suited for this dataset due to their ability to handle both numerical and categorical features, such as the binary columns for wilderness areas and soil types. Random Forests are capable of capturing non-linear relationships, selecting relevant features, and providing robust predictions. They are also less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees. Random Forests have been widely used in various domains for classification tasks, including predicting forest cover types.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ensemble Model:** an ensemble model combines predictions from multiple individual models to improve overall performance. By leveraging the diverse strengths of different models, an ensemble can capture a wider range of patterns and reduce the risk of individual model biases. In our case, we can create an ensemble by combining the predictions of the selected machine learning models (such as Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, GBoosting, and Random Forests) using techniques like Voting Classifier or Stacking. \n",
    "\n",
    "By considering and evaluating these diverse machine learning models, we can explore their unique characteristics and strengths to make accurate predictions of forest cover types based on the provided cartographic variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By employing these six machine learning models, we aim to harness their unique strengths and capabilities in order to accurately predict forest cover types for our dataset. Through rigorous model evaluation and comparison, we will select the best-performing model that achieves the highest prediction accuracy and generalization performance."

    "In ML, having a large amount of data is crucial for training models that can accurately make predictions. However, processing large datasets can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially when running multiple models. Therefore, using a smaller subset of the data can help to reduce the time and computational resources required for training and testing models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, using a subset of 100,000 instances allows us to build and test multiple models quickly without sacrificing too much data. By randomly selecting a subset, we can ensure that the sample is representative of the larger dataset while reducing the overall size of the data. This approach can be particularly useful when dealing with big data, where even a small subset can be sufficiently representative of the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, using a smaller subset can also help to avoid overfitting, which occurs when a model is trained too closely on the training data and fails to generalize to new data. By using a smaller subset, we can limit the complexity of the models we build, making them less likely to overfit."

    "The research on environmental monitoring and forest cover analysis necessitates careful consideration of evaluation metrics to assess machine learning model performance. In this study, the utilization of \"accuracy\" and \"balanced accuracy\" as evaluation parameters proves highly motivating for several reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy, a widely embraced metric in machine learning, gauges the proportion of correctly classified instances among the total instances in the dataset. Aiming for high accuracy entails the development of models that effectively predict forest cover types based on provided cartographic variables. As an evaluation parameter, accuracy, motivates the focus on minimizing misclassifications, recognizing that even small errors in classifying forest cover types can have consequences. Striving for high accuracy ensures the provision of effective and reliable information for forest management decisions, wildfire prevention strategies, conservation planning, and climate change adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We also used Confusion Matrix for understanding the types of errors a model is making. However, the confusion matrix alone does not provide a single aggregated metric that represents overall model performance, which is important for making informed decisions in environmental monitoring and forest management.Therefore, we used it as for further understanding but not as our main evaluation parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why not other Evaluation methods?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision, recall, and AUC-ROC are valuable evaluation metrics that provide a comprehensive view of a model's performance. However, in the context of our research on environmental monitoring and forest cover analysis in Colorado, we chose not to utilize them for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision: in our case, precision may not be the most suitable metric because the focus is not solely on identifying positive instances, but rather on accurately classifying different forest cover types. Precision alone does not provide sufficient information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall: while recall is important in scenarios where identifying all positive instances is critical, such as in medical diagnosis, our research primarily focuses on understanding the state of the forest ecosystem and identifying potential threats to its health.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC-ROC: in our paper, where the primary focus is on accurate forest cover type classification rather than binary classification, the AUC-ROC may not provide a suitable evaluation metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the adoption of accuracy and balanced accuracy as evaluation parameters in this research emphasizes the development of reliable models for forest cover type classification. The aim is always to obtain high accuracy that ensures our models contribute to informed decision-making, promote an impact on forest management, conservation efforts, and the overall well-being of Colorado's forests and ecosystems."

The rows of the matrix represent the true class labels, and the columns represent the predicted class labels. Each cell contains the number of instances for a specific combination of true and predicted labels. The diagonal elements of the matrix correspond to correct predictions, while the off-diagonal elements represent incorrect predictions. In this case, the confusion matrix is visualized as a heatmap to better understand the model's performance across different classes\n",

However, it is important to note that decision trees also have drawbacks, one being their tendency to overfit the training data. In order to mitigate this issue, we played around with hyperparameters such as maximum depth and finetuned the model, as can be seen by its accuracy of 0.86."

    "We set the maximum number of iterations to 500 to give the optimization algorithm enough iterations to converge to an optimal solution. In some cases, logistic regression models may require more iterations to find the optimal weights, especially when dealing with complex datasets or large feature spaces. By setting a higher number of iterations, we can ensure that the optimization algorithm has sufficient opportunities to find the best solution within the given constraint.\n",

This algorithm is an efficient optimization technique that approximates the BFGS algorithm using a limited amount of memory. This solver is suitable for large-scale problems and can handle a wide range of data sizes and complexities. Additionally, the 'lbfgs' solver works well with L2 regularization, which is commonly used in logistic regression to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.\n",

    "We specified the multi_class parameter as 'multinomial' to handle the multi-class classification problem. In a multi-class classification problem, there are more than two classes to predict. The 'multinomial' option enables the logistic regression model to handle such problems by using the softmax function to estimate probabilities for each class. By using the 'multinomial' option, we ensure that our logistic regression model is well-suited to handle the multi-class nature of the cover type classification problem."

    "#### Hyperparameter Tuning through GridSearchCV\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize the performance of the Random Forest Classifier, we are using GridSearchCV, which is a method for searching over hyperparameters by exhaustively trying all possible combinations within a defined parameter grid. We specify the parameter grid as a dictionary containing different values for the 'n_estimators' and 'max_depth' hyperparameters, which control the number of trees in the forest and the maximum depth of each tree, respectively. We first fit the SelectFromModel object to the training data to identify the most important features for classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters chosen to search and their ranges: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **n_estimators**: This is the number of trees in the forest. More trees usually lead to better performance due to more diverse subsets of the data being sampled, but at the cost of increased computational expense. The range [5, 10, 15] is quite low, which suggests that you're trying to keep the computational cost down. In general, more trees lead to better performance, up to a certain point, beyond which there are diminishing returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **max_depth**: This is the maximum depth of each tree. A deeper tree can capture more complex relationships by adding more splits, but it can also lead to overfitting. The range [10, 20, 30, None] allows for a good mix of tree depths. The 'None' option will allow trees to grow until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **min_samples_split**: This is the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. Higher values can help prevent overfitting by ensuring that splits are only made if they involve a certain number of samples. The range [2, 5, 10] is quite standard and provides a good balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **min_samples_leaf**: This is the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. Similar to min_samples_split, larger values here can help prevent overfitting, but if too high, they can lead to underfitting as well. The range [1, 2, 5] is quite standard and provides a good balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **max_features**: This is the number of features to consider when looking for the best split. The options 'auto', 'sqrt', and 'log2' are common choices. 'auto' and 'sqrt' will both result in the square root of the total number of features being considered at each split, while 'log2' will result in the log base 2 of the total number of features being considered. These options are used to add a further element of randomness to the ensemble, helping to make it more robust and less likely to overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ranges and options you've selected seem to be chosen to provide a good balance between preventing overfitting and allowing the model to capture complex patterns in the data, while also keeping computational costs reasonably low. It's always a good idea to experiment with these ranges based on the results you're getting, the size of your dataset, and the computational resources you have available.\n",
    "\n",
    "GridSearchCV:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\testimator: The ensemble model eclf is used as the estimator to tune.\n",
    "*\tparam_grid: The dictionary param_grid specifies the hyperparameters and their respective ranges.\n",
    "*\tcv=5: The cross-validation strategy with 5 folds is used to evaluate each combination of hyperparameters.\n",
    "*\tscoring='accuracy': The accuracy metric is used to evaluate the performance of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "GridSearchCV performs an exhaustive search over the hyperparameter grid (param_grid), evaluating each combination of hyperparameters using cross-validation. For each combination, the accuracy of the ensemble model is calculated based on the cross-validated performance. The best parameters are determined based on the combination that yields the highest accuracy. By searching over different combinations of hyperparameters, GridSearchCV helps to find the best configuration for the ensemble model. The chosen ranges for the hyperparameters cover a range of values that are likely to impact the model's performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The GridSearchCV process evaluates multiple models with different combinations of hyperparameters, enabling us to systematically explore the hyperparameter space and identify the configuration that yields the highest accuracy. By finding the best parameters, we can potentially improve the model's performance compared to using default hyperparameters or arbitrary choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we create a GridSearchCV object and fit it to the training data using 5-fold cross-validation. This step can take a considerable amount of time, especially for large datasets, as the GridSearchCV exhaustively tries all possible combinations of hyperparameters. Once the GridSearchCV is complete, we obtain the best hyperparameters and best model using the best_params_ and best_estimator_ attributes, respectively. "

    "In conclusion, our research on environmental monitoring and forest cover type analysis in Colorado has the potential to have a significant impact on sustainable forest management and decision-making processes. By utilizing machine learning models and the \"Covertype\" dataset, we can gain valuable insights into the state of forest ecosystems and identify potential threats to their health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the machine learning models we explored, the Random Forest algorithm emerged as the best method for predicting forest cover types based on cartographic variables. With an accuracy of 0.89, this model demonstrates strong performance in classifying different forest cover types. By accurately identifying the types of forests present in an area, we can better understand their characteristics, distribution, and potential vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest model's effectiveness is enhanced by the implementation of feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. Through feature selection techniques, we identify the most relevant variables that contribute to accurate predictions, allowing for more efficient and focused analysis. Additionally, the use of grid search helps optimize the model's hyperparameters, further improving its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implications of our research extend beyond academia. The insights gained from our analysis can inform informed decision-making processes, benefiting governments, conservation organizations, and other interested stakeholders. Forest management choices, wildfire prevention strategies, conservation planning, and climate change adaptation efforts can all be guided by the findings of our research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, our work can be utilized in environmental consulting services for organizations operating in or near forested areas in Colorado and Wyoming. By providing access to our research and models, these organizations can ensure compliance with wildfire prevention regulations, develop emergency response plans, and adhere to environmental laws and guidelines. This not only minimizes operational expenditures but also promotes sustainable practices, safeguarding the long-term sustainability of Colorado's forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the alarming increase in wildfires in recent years, our research is particularly timely and relevant. By accurately predicting forest cover types and identifying areas that are undergoing rapid change or are vulnerable to environmental threats, we can contribute to effective wildfire prevention and mitigation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, our scientific research using the Random Forest model and the \"Covertype\" dataset serves as a benchmark for sustainable forest management and environmental monitoring. The accuracy of 0.89 achieved by the Random Forest model demonstrates its robustness in predicting forest cover types based on cartographic variables. Through the integration of our findings into decision-making processes, governments, conservation organizations, and stakeholders can make better-informed choices to protect and preserve the forests of Colorado."
